# IITB RISC -- 6 staged pipelined microprocessor

## Introduction

This a 6 stage pipelined processor with 2 wide fetch, IITB-RISC, whose instruction set architecture is provided. IITB-RISC is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching purpose. The IITB-RISC is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system. It should follow the standard 6 stage pipelines (Instruction fetch, instruction decode, register read, execute, memory access, and write back) and fetches two instruction at a time. The architecture should be optimized for performance, i.e., should include hazard mitigation techniques. Hence, it should have at least data forwarding mechanism.
